# Normalization, clustering and annotation 
Gene-expression values were normalized using sctransform (v2). Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out using the variable features for the SCT Assay Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) analysis was performed to further reduce variation to two dimensions with ‘RunUMAP’ function with 25 to 40 principal components, and a resolution range from 0.6 to 2. These clusters were manually annotated based on differentially expressed genes generated from ‘FindAllMarkers’ function as well as the canonical marker genes from published literature. The command we use were as follows:
